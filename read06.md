### why functions:
i will start with this point to know why we creat it and use it and learn about it.
- because we can reuse code : Define the code once, and use it many times.
- You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
- organizing our code .



# javascript function 
 - is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

- is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
  - When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
  - When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
  - Automatically (self invoked)

## JavaScript Function Syntax
 is defined with the ***function*** keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
 The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

>function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) 
{
>  // code to be executed
>}
>

## Function Return
The return statement *** ends ***function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.

>function square(x) {
>  return x * x;
>}
